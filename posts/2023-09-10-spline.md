### Testing the waters with a 3D scene

I have wanted to revamp my personal website for a while now, but I was still rolling around ideas in my head. Recently, I discovered the 3D Design tool, [Spline](https://spline.design/), and it looks pretty sweet so I've decided to build a small project (an isometric mini-room) to figure out if Spline is something that I want to incorporate into my new site.
