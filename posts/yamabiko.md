### What, who, or where, and especially why `yamabiko`?

The inspiration for the name of the blog comes from Japanese folklore. The term `yamabiko` <span style="color:#fc8f32">(山彦)</span> is a mountain god, spirit, and [yōkai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%8Dkai). Direct translation from Japanese to English results in the term `echo`. In Tottori Prefecture, a yobuko <span style="color:#fc8f32">(呼子)</span> or a yobukodori <span style="color:#fc8f32">(呼子鳥)</span> that lives in the mountain is thought to let out the yamabiko's voice. It is usually depicted with gray fur, peach-colored belly, floppy ears, a large grin, and arms outstretched as though it is caught mid-shrug. 

The word also refers to the resonant echo commonly heard in vast mountains and canyons is thought to be the spirit answering. In the context of the haunting edcho, it is represented in writing as <span style="color:#fc8f32">幽谷響</span>.

I settled upon this name because the term echo felt like a good fit, as this blog is not supposed to be ground-breaking, enlightening, or all-encompassing. Rather, it serves as a sort of open journal for thoughts, progressions, and lessons learned throughout my design and development expeditions.
