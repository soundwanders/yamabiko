### What, who, or where, and especially why `yamabiko`?

The inspiration for the name of the blog comes from Japanese folklore. The term `yamabiko` is a mountain god, spirit, and [yōkai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%8Dkai). Direct translation from Japanese to English results in the term `echo`. The haunting echo commonly heard in vast mountains and canyons is thought to be the spirit answering. Written in Japanese, it's represented as <span style="color:#fc8f32">**幽谷響**</span>.

I settled upon this name because the term echo is very fitting, as this blog is not supposed to be revolutionary, enlightening, or all-encompassing. Rather, it serves as a sort of open journal for thoughts, progressions, and lessons learned throughout my design and development expeditions.
