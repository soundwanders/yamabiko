# The beginning of our journey

This is the start of our blogging expedition. Today we built this site using mendhak's `Eleventy Satisfactory` template, then we tinkered with the  <span style="color:#de768a">Bun</span> JavaScript runtime, because it's fun to try new things, and Bun has been everywhere lately! So far, it's hard to have a real opinion on `Bun`, but I love that we are pushing the envelope and not settling for `npm` as the default. As much as I have grown to appreciate `npm`, it's exciting to see another package manager get some love!
